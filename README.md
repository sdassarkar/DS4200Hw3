I added a variety of stylistic changes to my website, namely: <br>
    - changed the background color and font family of the text <br>
    - Added two types of image classes <br>
    - Added a navigation bar at the top for easy navigation to and from pages <br>
    - Added a hover color to the buttons to make it more visually dynamic <br>

Part 2 of the homework with the D3 boxplot, barplot, and lineplot is also in this repo in its own folder
