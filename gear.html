    <h3>My Fishing Gear (and what you need to be mindful of!)</h3>
    <p>
        When I go fishing, I like to bring along my favorite fishing gear and I'm very strategic with what I bring along so that I can catch the most fish!
        For freshwater fishing, I usually like to bring small live baits like worms and crickets. Live bait generally works better, but it can be difficult to find Live
        bait in colder months and its sometimes just gross, so artifical lures are a great alternative! I personally like to use artificial worms or crankbaits (small fake fish).
        Now, for saltwater fishing you almost exclusively want to use live bait like shrimp, squid, or small fish. There are artificial options, but I don't know much about them. Once you have
        your bait or lures, all you need is your rod, hook, and weight and you're good to go!
